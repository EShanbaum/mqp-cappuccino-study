Welcome to our study. This is a sample study to understand the effectiveness of the recording functionality for questions.

For each question, answer and then (optionally) record audio explaining your answer, speifically why you picked it. Use the mic button below each question to record your audio.

At the end of the study, you will be asked questions on how we can improve the mic button.
